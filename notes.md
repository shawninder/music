# Notes

When using the Chrome iPhone "simulator", youtube videos stop playing if you change tabs (put the app in the background!).

Is the converse possible?

Can a mobile browser pretend to be a desktop (perhaps by messing with the user-agent?) one and gain the capability to continue playback even as the app is sent to the background
