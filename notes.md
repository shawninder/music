# Notes

When using the Chrome iPhone "simulator", youtube videos stop playing if you change tabs (put the app in the background!).

Is the converse possible?

Can a mobile browser pretend to be a desktop (perhaps by messing with the user-agent?) one and gain the capability to continue playback even as the app is sent to the background

Stickiness of "Start a Party" and "Join a Party". In both cases, you can un-sticky them. Perhaps others, like "Help" and "UpNext:insert" could be sticky-weighed so-to speak and bubble to the top...



Flashing seek bar aura indicates that music is playing and delimits the region in which seek-by-drag can be initiated

Idea: Host party where guests can only submit contributions to UpNext, and only those in the form either of music or short time blocks for short speeches or rallying call, optionally amplified by speaking into a phone and having the sound projected by the host speaker. Perfect for rallies, sit-ins, assemblies, exhibitions, all kinds of events!
