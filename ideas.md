# Ideas

Keep certain key party names as host and
  - broadcast them as radio stations (eg: playlist.city/montreal)
  - imbue them with special rules for demonstrations (eg: playlist.city/demo[...])
  - or specific locked content for walkthroughs (eg: playlist.city/help[...])
  - use them to test system endurance and history and upNext lengths limits (all of them)
  - Press enter (or tap) 7 times in rapid succession (toggling the actions) to interrupt play
  - Add a song from your device button at the end of the queue (and somewhere in the menu)
